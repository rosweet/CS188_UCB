This is the code for the problems from the Coding Assignment in the CS188 (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) class at UC Berkeley. 
(CS188 Su23 was held during the Summer Session from June 20, 2023, to August 10, 2023.) 

The team member who worked on this project with me is [jwoo-park]. 

The coding assignments cover various AI-related topics such as search, game, Bayes net, Q-learning, and neural networks. 
All test cases were successful. 

Once again, thanks to my beloved jwoo-park.
